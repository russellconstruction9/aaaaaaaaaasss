# ⚠️ SECURITY NOTICE ⚠️

I cannot provide actual API keys for the following important security reasons:

## 🔒 Why I Can't Provide API Keys:

1. **Security Risk**: API keys are private credentials that should never be shared
2. **Account Safety**: Using someone else's keys could compromise your account
3. **Billing Issues**: API keys are tied to billing accounts
4. **Terms Violation**: Sharing keys violates most API terms of service
